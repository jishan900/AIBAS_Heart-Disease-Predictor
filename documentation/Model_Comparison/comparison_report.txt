MODEL COMPARISON REPORT
======================

TASK COMPARISON:
- OLS Model: Predicts continuous cardiovascular risk score (0-1 scale)
- ANN Model: Predicts binary heart disease presence (0/1 classification)

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
===================

OLS Regression Results:
- Target: Continuous risk_score
- Test R²: 0.9998
- Test RMSE: 0.0017
- Training R²: 0.9999
- Adjusted R²: 0.9999

ANN Classification Results:
- Target: Binary cardio disease
- Test Accuracy: 0.7112 (71.1%)
- Training Accuracy: 0.6494
- Validation Accuracy: 0.6911

FEATURE USAGE:
=============
Both models use 11 features:
age, gender, height, weight, ap_hi, ap_lo, cholesterol, gluc, smoke, alco, active

MODEL CHARACTERISTICS:
=====================

OLS Strengths:
+ Highly interpretable coefficients
+ Fast training and prediction
+ Statistical significance testing
+ Perfect fit to risk score (R² ≈ 1.0)



ANN Strengths:
+ Handles non-linear relationships
+ Good generalization (71% accuracy)
+ Robust to feature interactions
+ More realistic performance metrics



DIAGNOSTIC INSIGHTS:
===================
- OLS Durbin-Watson: 1.9587 (close to 2.0 = good)
- Both models use same preprocessed features
- Different targets make direct comparison challenging
- Consider ensemble approach combining both predictions
